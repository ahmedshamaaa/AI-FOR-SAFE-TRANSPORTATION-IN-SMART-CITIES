# PROJECT IDEA:
  The system idea is to detect accidents on the road and the probability
  of it happening in the future through analysis, and in case of
  occurrence of such an event this will inform the appropriate
  authorities and other interested parties with real-time information.
  also detect severity automated.
  
# AI Model Used:
  -We used the CNN model
  to indicate whether an
  accident occurred or not.
  -We used the YOLO
  model to detect Severity
  of the accident
  
# STAKEHOLDERS:
  - Normal user
  -Tracker

# FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
  -Ability to detect accidents in real-time
  using various sensor inputs such as
  cameras.
  -Ability to inform the appropriate
  authorities by the tracker (take action).
  -The ability to generate real-time traffic
  flow data, including traffic congestion
  and delays, to help manage traffic and
  reduce the risk of accidents occurrence
  (GPS API).
  -The ability to store, retrieve and provide
  accidents data reports and statistics to
  authorities and other interested parties
  for future analysis and reporting.

# NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
  -Performance
  -Reliability
  -Security
  -Maintainability
  -Interoperability
  -Usability
  -Portability
  -Availability

# USED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYLCE (SDLC):
  -In our project, we have adopted the Agile Scrum methodology
  for the development of AI-powered solutions in safe
  transportation for smart cities.
  -By embracing Agile Scrum, we delivered high-quality results,
  foster collaboration, and adapt to evolving requirements
  throughout the project lifecycle.

# Security:
  -JWT (JSON web Token) is created
  after authentication.
  -JWT is used to authorize users.
  -We apply validation to our token to
  complete the user's request.
  -Each token has expiry date and
  revoke attributes.
  -We used HTTPs for further security .
  -We have white- and blacklists for APIs
  to restrict access of users based on
  authority and authentication status.

# DELIVERABLES:
  -Real-time accident detection with
  its severity and optimized traffic
  flow are the key outcomes of our
  AI-powered safe transportation
  solutions for smart cities.
  
# Recommendations:
  -Proactive Incident Detection:
  Developing advanced AI models to
  predict and detect potential accidents in advance, enabling preventive
  measures and timely interventions.

# USED TECHNOLOGIES:
  - Angular - YOLO
  - Router - TensorFlow
  - Spring boot - MySQL
  - Python - Flask
  - Microservices
# Dataset:
  -We used dataset provided by
  DELL
